											<h2>Introduction</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											With the growing emphasis on clean transportation, the demand for electric vehicles (EVs) 
											is increasing. However, there currently are not <br />enough EV charging stations to meet this 
											demand. Many of the existing chargers are concentrated in specific areas, leaving large
											parts of <br />the city underserved. This imbalance can lead to equity issues, range anxiety, 
											and congestion around existing chargers.
										  </p>
										  <p>
											EVCS-OPTIM seeks to address these challenges while also optimizing placement to keep 
											energy costs affordable for ratepayers. Our project <br />uses data-driven methodologies, 
											including geospatial analysis and optimization modeling, to find the most effective 
											parking lot locations for <br />new EV charging stations within San Diego County. By 
											integrating previous EV adoption data, traffic patterns, and proximity information, 
											this <br />project provides an interactive tool to assist San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E), 
											which owns and operates thousands of EV charging stations<br /> across the region, in 
											strategically expanding its EV infrastructure.

															<h3>Data Analysis</h3>
															<p>
																We conducted correlation analysis to determine what factors influence 
																the location of current EV charging locations. Based on this analysis, we selected the following features: 
																distance to the nearest charger, number of chargers within a specific radius, total charging points available 
																at nearby stations, proximity to high-traffic areas, zoning data, and the population demographic and median 
																income of the zone in which the parking lot is located.

															<h3>Standardization and Weights</h3>
															<p>
																Each parking lot was assigned a percentile rank (0-1) for each feature relative to all other 
																locations. The standardized features were then assigned weights based on their importance to 
																EV charging demand. For instance, the "chargers in radius" feature received a negative weight, 
																as we aim to recommend parking lots that are farther from existing stations. On the 
																other hand, features that likely indicate higher demand, such as "proximity to 
																high-traffic areas," were given positive weights.

															<h3>Demand Score</h3>
															<p>
																After assigning the weights, we calculated a demand score for each parking lot. 
																To normalize the scores, we applied Min-Max scaling, ensuring that the absolute value of 
																all the scores fall within a range of 0 to 1. Higher scores indicate a stronger recommendation, 
																while negative scores suggest that the parking lot should not be recommended.

															<h3>Recommendation Method</h3>
															<p>
																The demand scores for the parking lots were ranked from highest to lowest and assigned 
																one of three recommendation labels: highly recommended, recommended, or not recommended. 
																The parking lots are then displayed on the interactive map along with additional details 
																about each parking lot.

											<h3>Standardization and Weights</h3>
											<h4>Percentile Ranking</h4>
											<p>Each parking lot's performance is measured for each of 
												the different features. To make comparisons easier, the 
												scores for each feature are normalized using percentile 
												ranking. This means that each parking lot is given a rank 
												(from 0 to 1) based on how it compares to all other parking 
												lots for that specific feature. A higher rank closer to 1 
												indicates better performance in that feature, while a rank 
												closer to 0 suggests lower performance. This standardization 
												process ensures that each feature is normalized, making it easier 
												to compare and combine them into a final score.
											</p>
											<p>Percentile Ranking Formula:</p>
											<p>
												\( P_{f,i} = \frac{\text{rank of location i for feature f} - 1}{\text{total number of locations} - 1} \)
											</p>
											
											<h4>Empirical Probabilities</h4>
											<p>Based off of our data analysis results, we determined that the zone the 
												parking lot is in has a strong correlation with the location of a charger. 
												Therefore, we ranked city zoning scores through empirical distribution 
												probabilities of existing charger placement. Here are the assigned scores for 
												the following land use categories: 
											</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Commercial zones: 1.0 (optimal for public charging)</li>
												<li>Office zones: 0.8 (suitable for workplace charging)</li>
												<li>Mixed-use zones: 0.7 (valuable for diverse usage)</li>
												<li>Transit zones: 0.6 (strategic for transportation connections)</li>
												<li>Industrial zones: 0.5 (moderate potential for workplace charging)</li>
												<li>Residential zones: High (0.3), Medium (0.2),Low (0.1)</li>
												<li>Agricultural and open space zones: 0.0 (limited compatibility)</li>
											</ul>

											<h3>Weights</h3>
											<p>We assigned the following weights for the features:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Distance to nearest charger: +0.5 (prioritizing underserved areas)</li>
												<li>Chargers in radius: -0.3 (penalizing redundancy)</li>
												<li>Total charging points: -0.2 (avoiding oversaturation)</li>
												<li>Traffic volume: +0.1 (favoring high-traffic areas)</li>
												<li>Population density: +0.2 (serving residential demand)</li>
												<li>Median income: +0.1 (accounting for EV adoption patterns)</li>
												<li>Zoning score: 0.1 multiplier (incorporating land use)</li>
											</ul>
											
											<h3>Demand Score Calculation</h3>
											<p>To calculate the demand score for each parking lot, we multiplied 
												the weight of each feature by its respective percentile ranking.
											</p>
											<p>
												\[
												\text{Demand Score} = (0.5 \times P_{\text{distance to nearest charger}}) + \\
												(-0.3 \times P_{\text{chargers in radius}}) + \\
												(-0.2 \times P_{\text{total charging points}}) + \\
												(0.1 \times P_{\text{traffic}}) + \\
												(0.2 \times P_{\text{population}}) + \\
												(0.1 \times P_{\text{median income}}) + \\
												(0.1 \times \text{zoning score})
												\]
											</p>
											<p>We normalized the demand scores by using Min-Max scaling.</p>
											<p>
												\[
												\text{Normalized Demand Score} = \frac{\text{Demand Score} - \min(\text{Demand Score})}{\max(\text{Demand Score}) - \min(\text{Demand Score})}
												\]

													We developed an interface that allows users to input a zip code and specify the 
													number of parking lots they want recommended. These <br />recommendations are displayed 
													on an interactive map, with a tooltip feature to display additional details for 
													each parking lot. We also <br />included a factor analysis section at the bottom, 
													explaining how the recommendations were calculated and why specific locations 
													were <br />suggested. Overall, the model performs well, recommending parking lots based on user inputs 
													and categorizing them as highly recommended, <br />recommended, or not recommended. The model returns the 
													maximum feasible locations if the user requests more recommendations <br />than are available in a given zip code.
												</p>
												<p>
													After analyzing the results, we identified several trends with the top-ranked 
													locations. Many were distant from existing infrastructure, <br />indicating the tool's 
													effectiveness in identifying underserved areas. Other trends include proximity to 
													mixed-use zones, commercial <br />districts, high-traffic areas, and high population 
													density, showing a need for chargers in more populous areas.
												</p>
	
												<p>
													However, the model does have a few limitations. The parking lot dataset relies on 
													user-contributed data, which may lead to missing <br />or incomplete information. 
													Additionally, the tool is currently limited to SDG&E's service areas and uses 
													static assumptions, restricting <br />its generalizability to other regions and future 
													urban development. Furthermore, the model hasn't been tested with city planners or EV 
													<br />drivers, which could limit the applicability of the recommendations.

										<h2 class="major"><span>Conclusion</span></h2>
										<section class="box highlight">
											<p>
												Our project addresses the growing need for more EV charging stations
												to support the increased demand for electric vehicles. By utilizing <br />
												our interactive map, we aim to identify areas with the greatest need 
												for new chargers, helping assist SDG&E's clean transportation team <br />
												in planning the placement of future EV chargers. While there are some 
												limitations to our work, we hope this project can be used as a <br />foundation 
												for future expansion and improvement in EV infrastructure.
											</p>

											<p>
												Ultimately, this project is a step toward meeting the rising demand 
												for electric vehicles, supporting the transition to clean transportation,
												<br />and contributing to a more sustainable future. We hope to work with city 
												 planners, utility companies, and other stakeholders to <br />expand EV charging access.
