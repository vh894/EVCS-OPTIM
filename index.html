											<h2>Introduction</h2>
											<!--<p>And some text that attempts to explain their significance</p>-->
										</header>
										<p>
											With the growing emphasis on clean transportation, the demand for electric vehicles (EVs) 
											is increasing. However, there currently are not <br />enough EV charging stations to meet this 
											demand. Many of the existing chargers are concentrated in specific areas, leaving large
											parts of <br />the city underserved. This imbalance can lead to equity issues, range anxiety, 
											and congestion around existing chargers.
										  </p>
										  <p>
											EVCS-OPTIM seeks to address these challenges while also optimizing placement to keep 
											energy costs affordable for ratepayers. Our project <br />uses data-driven methodologies, 
											including geospatial analysis and optimization modeling, to find the most effective 
											parking lot locations for <br />new EV charging stations within San Diego County. By 
											integrating previous EV adoption data, transit patterns, and proximity information, 
											the <br />project provides an interactive tool to assist San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E), 
											which owns and operates thousands of EV charging stations<br /> across the region, in 
											strategically expanding its EV infrastructure.

															<h3><a href="#">Data Analysis</a></h3>
															<p>
																We conducted correlation analysis to determine what factors influence 
																the location of current EV charging locations. Based on this analysis, we selected the following features: 
																distance to the nearest charger, number of chargers already at a parking lot,
																number of chargers within a specific radius, proximity to high-traffic areas, 
																proximity to transit stops, and population demographics of the zone in which 
																the parking lot is located.

															<h3><a href="#">Weights</a></h3>
															<p>
																Each feature was assigned a weight based on its correlation with the locations 
																of existing chargers. Features that we wanted to avoid were given negative weights. 
																For instance, the "distance to the nearest charger" feature received a negative weight, 
																as we aim to recommend parking lots that are farther from existing stations. On the 
																other hand, features that likely indicate higher demand, such as "proximity to 
																high-traffic areas," were given positive weights.

															<h3><a href="#">Demand Score</a></h3>
															<p>
																After assigning the weights, we calculated a demand score for each parking lot. 
																To standardize the scores, we applied min-max scaling, ensuring that all scores 
																fell within the range of 0 to 1.

															<h3><a href="#">Recommendation Methods</a></h3>
															<p>
																We utilized two different recommendation methods for our model. If any parking lots' 
																scores exceeded a predefined threshold, we recommend those lots. If none of the scores 
																exceeded the threshold, we ranked the parking lots by their demand scores and recommended 
																the ones with the highest scores.

												<p>
													We developed an interface that allows users to input a zip code and specify the 
													number of parking lots they want recommended. These <br />recommendations are displayed 
													on an interactive map, with a tooltip feature to display additional details for 
													each parking lot. We also <br />included a factor analysis section at the bottom, 
													explaining how the recommendations were calculated and why specific locations 
													were <br />suggested. Overall, the model performs well, recommending parking lots based on user inputs 
													and categorizing them as highly recommended, <br />recommended, or not recommended. The model returns the 
													maximum feasible locations if the user requests more recommendations <br />than are available in a given zip code.
												</p>
												<p>
													After analyzing the results, we identified several trends with the top-ranked 
													locations. Many were distant from existing infrastructure, <br />indicating the tool's 
													effectiveness in identifying underserved areas. Other trends include proximity to 
													mixed-use zones, commercial <br />districts, high-traffic areas, and high population 
													density, showing a need for chargers in more populous areas.
												</p>
	
												<p>
													However, the model does have a few limitations. The parking lot dataset relies on 
													user-contributed data, which may lead to missing <br />or incomplete information. 
													Additionally, the tool is currently limited to SDG&E's service areas and uses 
													static assumptions, restricting <br />its generalizability to other regions and future 
													urban development. Finally, the model hasn't been tested with city planners or EV 
													<br />drivers, which could limit the applicability of the recommendations.

										<h2 class="major"><span>Conclusion</span></h2>
										<section class="box highlight">
											<p>
												Our project addresses the growing need for more EV charging stations
												to support the increased demand for electric vehicles. By utilizing <br />
												our interactive map, we aim to identify areas with the greatest need 
												for new chargers, helping assist SDG&E's clean transportation team <br />
												in planning the placement of future EV chargers. While there are some 
												limitations to our work, we hope this project can be used as a <br />foundation 
												for future expansion and improvement in EV infrastructure.
											</p>

											<p>
												Ultimately, this project is a step toward meeting the rising demand 
												for electric vehicles, supporting the transition to clean transportation,
												<br />and contributing to a more sustainable future. We hope to work with city 
												 planners, utility companies, and other stakeholders to <br />expand EV charging access.
